## Thin Lens Equation & Magnification Calculator
Program will ask for inputs & return variables + the equation.\
Please **only** enter **the number** (no cm, mm, etc. along with other names)\
Use **enter** when you dont know the value of a field (minimum two required)

Example input/output:
```
INPUT:
focal point (f): 10
distance from image (di): -25
distance from object (do): 

VARIABLES:
f: 0.1
di: -0.04
do: 7.142857
magnification: 3.5

FORMULA (THIN-LENS & MAGNIFICATION):
1/do = 1/10 - 1/-25 = 0.1 - -0.04 = 7.142857
M = -25/7.142857 * -1 = 3.5
```
